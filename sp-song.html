              <h2>About</h2>
              <p class="abt-each">
                Dr. Song Lin, a trailblazer in the world of organic chemistry
                and electrochemical systems, now making waves in the
                Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell
                University.
                <br /><br />
                Song's journey in the realm of chemistry began in Tianjin,
                China. After obtaining his B.S. from Peking University, he
                took the leap to Harvard University, working closely with
                Professor Eric Jacobsen. During this period, Song delved deep
                into the intricacies of enantioselective reactions steered by
                multifunctional hydrogen-bond donors. This foundation set the
                stage for an illustrious postdoctoral stint at UC Berkeley
                with Professor Chris Chang, where he harnessed the potential
                of molecularly tunable materials like covalent organic
                frameworks. These innovations aimed at transforming CO2 into
                products of significant value through electrochemical
                processes. By the summer of 2016, Song brought his rich
                expertise to Cornell, swiftly rising through the ranks to Full
                Professor by January 2023.
                <br /><br />
                At the helm of the Lin Lab, Song and his team are reshaping
                the landscape of organic chemistry. They're driven by a vision
                to harness the unique abilities of electrochemical systems,
                thereby expanding the horizons of sustainable synthetic
                chemistry. Whether it's the judicious design of catalysts or
                innovative electrochemical methods, the Lin Lab's work
                primarily revolves around turning easily accessible raw
                materials into high-value outputs, from medicines to polymers.
                <br /><br />
                Away from the hustle of the lab, Song unwinds by indulging in
                exercise, watching and playing tennis and pool. He cherishes
                time with his shiba inus, Cooper and Tako, and takes delight
                in exploring the picturesque landscapes and diverse cuisine of
                upstate New York with his loved ones.
